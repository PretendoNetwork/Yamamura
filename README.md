# nuyama - yamamura's rewrite branch

## a pretendo-integrated Discord bot by superwhiskers & friends

### disclaimer

this branch is not intended for normal use, i recommend that you **_do not use this right now_**, until it is stable enough for normal use, or until i merge it into **master**. seriously, if you know what's good for you, the amount of rewriting here will proably give you a seizure, and i have a specific order in which i'm rewriting this.

### status

here's what i have done right now:

- [ ] - *not started* - yamamura.py

- [ ] - *ongoing*     - doc.py

- [ ] - *mostly done* - db.py

- [ ] - *not started* - cmd.py

- [ ] - *ongoing*     - utils.py

*are you surprised?* you shouldn't be. not at all, since this is a pretty big ordeal to take on, considering the extremely large amount of new features to be implemented. expect minor progress updates every once in a while.
